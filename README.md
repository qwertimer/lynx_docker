This is Lynx with rwxrobs preferred settings including:

* Vim bindings

## Installation 

Using the Docker image above is the preferred way to get going quickly.


## Search Tools

I've included the scripts that enable the `?` and `??` and `???` CLI
search aliases. Just add [`duck`](bin/duck), [`google`](bin/google), and
[`bing`](bin/bing) to your `$PATH` and the following somewhere in your RC
file to enable the aliases:

```
alias '?'=duck
alias '??'=google
alias '???'=bing
```
